    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=A6:5B:B2:CD:10:C1:C6:AB:74:0C:64:FA:F7:FF:36:E3:17:72:D7:AF%3Ba_barbu.gps_agenda

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    A6:5B:B2:CD:10:C1:C6:AB:74:0C:64:FA:F7:FF:36:E3:17:72:D7:AF;a_barbu.gps_agenda

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
